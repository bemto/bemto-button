This is a foundation for all the buttons I use in my markup for more than 4 years. Now in a form of a React component, using [bemto-components](https://github.com/kizu/bemto-components) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

This is the base for highly functional and stylable buttons which provides basic reset & layout which you could later easily style by extending with styled-components. This component has all the powers of bemto-components beneath, so you can use modifiers, polymorphic tags and all the other stuff. See the docs of [bemto-components](http://kizu.ru/bemto-components/#elements) for more features and [this component's source code](https://github.com/bemto/bemto-button) to how easily it is done.

The documentation for the bemto-button is available as a [section of bemto-components' docs](http://kizu.ru/bemto-components/#bemtobutton). You could see there all the features of bemto-button and play with them right in your browser in an interactive playgrounds.

### Installation & Usage

In your console:

``` sh
npm install --save bemto-button
```

Then in `.js`-files of your components:

``` js static
import BemtoButton from 'bemto-button';
```
